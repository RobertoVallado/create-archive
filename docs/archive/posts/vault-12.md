# Balance Beyond the Grind: Navigating Burnout in a Busy World

Ouff, it’s been a while since the last time I wrote anything. I will begin by saying that teaching at college has been challenging, rewarding, but also time-consuming. As I prepared a class a month away from the finish line, I realized I have been spending my weekends entirely doing research, preparing schoolwork, and grading assignments; I have stopped doing the things that I enjoy doing. This brings me to contemplate life from a different angle.

I consider myself a well-organized individual who takes pride in how I invest my time. I love to lay out my week on Sundays as I try to be my most productive self; but lately I feel I have to drag my feet to find time to do the things I need to do. I have stopped hacking and working on my personal projects on the weekends—all for a little extra cash. Today’s culture asks us to be this way, I blame, but I’m not sure if it is that or just me trying to find a culprit for my low levels of motivation.  

Things are going to accumulate, and we might not feel the same way every day—I get that—but I feel I have been trying to pour little drops of me into multiple cups, leaving little for myself on the weekends. Do I need to rest more? I don’t want to. I have work to do.

## So, it seems I have an issue… a PROBLEM

What do I do as a pragmatic programmer when I encounter a problem? I try to understand it so I can tackle it from different angles, and, of course, google it 😅  

Well, what do you know—the first answer points to **burnout**.

## Le Burnout

Burnout is a common experience, especially for individuals juggling multiple responsibilities and commitments. It's essential to recognize when we're feeling overwhelmed and take steps to prioritize self-care and rekindle our motivation.  

Firstly, it's crucial to acknowledge that burnout is a valid and understandable response to prolonged stress and exhaustion. It's not a sign of weakness but rather a signal that our mind and body need a break and some nurturing. Sometimes, the pressures of work and other obligations can cause us to lose sight of our passions and hobbies, leading to a sense of emptiness or disconnection.

## Bring Yo'self to Le Present, amigo!

Finding ways to reconnect with the activities that bring you joy and fulfillment is key to combating burnout. While it may feel counterintuitive to carve out time for yourself when you're already stretched thin, investing in activities that recharge your batteries can ultimately improve your productivity and overall well-being.  

Whether it's spending time outdoors, engaging in creative pursuits, or simply relaxing with loved ones, making time for self-care is essential for maintaining a healthy work-life balance.  

Additionally, it's essential to challenge the cultural narrative that glorifies overwork and sacrifice. While dedication and hard work are admirable qualities, they shouldn't come at the expense of our mental and physical health. Learning to set boundaries, delegate tasks, and prioritize tasks can help prevent burnout and ensure that you're able to sustainably pursue your goals and aspirations.  

Remember that it's okay to ask for help when you need it and to seek support from friends, family, or mental health professionals if you're struggling to cope. By prioritizing self-care and setting realistic expectations for yourself, you can navigate periods of doubt and uncertainty with resilience and determination.  

Ultimately, finding balance and fulfillment in both your personal and professional life is a journey, and it's essential to be patient and compassionate with yourself along the way.

Both my jobs are great, and I have people that support me as well as people I can rely upon for help. It is the "self" I struggle with because I admit I can be **“not kind”** to myself sometimes. Having a great work environment where I feel supported is something I recognize and I’m grateful for.  

I tell myself I love myself by sitting down and taking the time to write this down—to put my thoughts down and quiet the mind.  

Despite the challenges and moments of doubt, it's important to remind ourselves of our worth and the value of the work we do. It's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of everyday life, constantly striving for perfection and productivity. However, it's essential to remember that our self-worth is not determined solely by our achievements or the number of tasks we tick off our to-do list.  

I tell myself I love myself by saying it's okay to have a break, and it's okay if I didn't complete that task within the expected timeframe.  

In moments of self-doubt and uncertainty, it's crucial to practice self-compassion and remind ourselves of our strengths and accomplishments. Reflecting on past successes and acknowledging the progress we've made can help boost our confidence and reignite our motivation to keep pushing forward, even when the path ahead seems daunting.  

I tell myself I love myself by taking myself out on a coffee date or for a walk in the beautiful area I have the chance to live in at the moment, or to go for a run (now that the weather allows it) 😁  

It's also important to cultivate a supportive network of friends, family, and colleagues who can offer encouragement and perspective during challenging times. Sharing our struggles and seeking advice from others can provide valuable insights and help us gain a fresh perspective on our situation.  

I tell myself I love myself by being vulnerable with others and being the best version of me there is.  

At the moment, my circle is my coworkers and my Canadian family; I consider myself extremely lucky to have them in my life. 🍀  

Navigating periods of burnout and uncertainty requires a combination of self-awareness, self-care, and resilience. By prioritizing our well-being and taking proactive steps to address the underlying causes of burnout, we can regain our motivation and continue pursuing our goals with renewed energy and enthusiasm.  

So, as I reflect on my own journey and the challenges I've faced, I remind myself that it's okay to take a step back, recharge, and realign my priorities. After all, true success is not measured by how busy we are or how many tasks we accomplish, but by our ability to find balance, fulfillment, and happiness in both our personal and professional lives. :)
