# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Basics and Prevention

**Understanding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of web security vulnerability where malicious scripts are injected into trusted websites. Hackers take advantage of web applications with poor input validation or encoding errors, which can lead to significant security risks. When a user visits the compromised site, the browser unknowingly executes the injected script, giving the attacker access to sensitive information such as cookies and session tokens.

There are varying degrees of complexity when it comes to exploiting XSS. The three main types are **DOM-based**, **stored**, and **reflected**. In this reflection, I focus on the fundamentals: definitions, consequences, and prevention measures.

## Consequences of XSS

XSS vulnerabilities can lead to several severe consequences for both web applications and users:

### **Data Theft**
Attackers can steal sensitive data, including login credentials, personal information, and financial details.

### **Unauthorized Access**
Malicious scripts can hijack user sessions, giving attackers access to accounts without needing passwords.

### **Website Defacement**
Attackers can rewrite the content of a web page, altering its appearance or injecting harmful material.

### **Phishing Attacks**
XSS can be used to trick users into entering information into fake forms designed by attackers.

### **Browser Exploitation**
XSS can exploit browser vulnerabilities, causing crashes or other unintended behavior.

## Preventing XSS as a User

I have a better understanding of how XSS scenarios happened and what they look like irl. But for many normies, recognizing signs of exposure or compromise ain't easy.

>Indicators and steps to stay safe:

### **Educate Yourself About Phishing Tactics**
Learn how phishing attacks work and recognize the tricks attackers use.  
And seriously — **read IT emails addressed to you**. They matter.

### **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**
Strong, unique passwords reduce the risk of account compromise, even if some information is leaked.

### **Check Website URLs Carefully**
Always verify the URL before entering sensitive information. Phishing pages often mimic legitimate sites.

## Preventing XSS as a Developer

To prevent XSS vulnerabilities, developers must adopt secure coding practices and avoid dangerous patterns. 

>But what does that actually mean?

### **Input Validation**
Validate and sanitize *anything* coming from the user.  
Treat every user as a potential attacker.

Many libraries and frameworks already offer reliable input validation—just take a little time to choose what best fits your project.

### **Output Encoding**
Encode dynamic content before displaying it in the browser to prevent unintended script execution.

If code reaches the browser, the browser will try to run it. Avoid sending executable content unless it is safe.

Again, many frameworks help with this by design—**use it**.

## Conclusion

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a dangerous web vulnerability that enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into applications.

As users, we can take simple steps to reduce our risk. As developers, we have an even greater responsibility to protect the people who trust our applications.

I will continue the XSS saga, as it is the topic I'm currently exploring.
