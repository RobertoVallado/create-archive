# About

A source of insight, practical pointers,and reflections on application security and clean-code practices.

In this site, I share my findings as I explore security exploits, vulnerabilities, and software in general. My goal is to grow as a hacker, developer, and bug bounty hunter, while keeping security, clarity, and maintainability at the core of everything I do.

I also use these entries as a personal knowledge base: a place to document/jot down what I’ve learned, organize useful concepts, keep track of things I want to revisit and archive information I want to keep coming back to as I continue growing my skills.

> For anyone who values **Clean Code**, **Good Development Practices**, and **Application Security**, and is on their own journey of improvement.
